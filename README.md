A DXF/DWG viewer and editor that runs entirely in the browser — parsing,
geometry processing and rendering (Three.js / WebGL) happen on the client, so
drawings never leave the user's device.

## What this fork adds

- **Japanese UI** — a complete `ja` locale for every package (viewer, ribbon,
  command line, dialogs, plugins, diff viewer, offline HTML export). The
  browser language is detected automatically.
- **Self-hosted fonts, no CAD CDN** — fonts and drawing templates are served
  from the app itself (`resources/cad-data` → `./cad-data/`).
  - Drawing text: **BIZ UD Gothic / Mincho** are bundled and used for
    MS Gothic / MS Mincho and as the default fallback, so Japanese never falls
    back to Chinese glyph shapes.
  - Other scripts load on demand from **Google Fonts** (Arial → Arimo,
    SimSun → Noto Serif SC, Malgun Gothic → Noto Sans KR, …).
  - UI text: **Noto Sans JP** (self-hosted via `@fontsource-variable/noto-sans-jp`).
- **Localized new drawings** — print page tabs show `キャンバス / 印刷ページ1 / 印刷ページ2`
  (or the active language) instead of the template's Chinese names.
- **Plain-language terms for non-CAD users** — the UI uses everyday words: Block → Symbol,
  block attribute → symbol property, Model space → Canvas, Layout → Print page,
  Hatch → Pattern fill, Xref → Linked drawing, Quick Select → Select by Criteria, and so on.
  Tooltips keep the CAD term in parentheses (all locales).
- **Movable tool bar** — drag the grip (⠿) to move the tool bar anywhere; the ⋯ menu next to it switches
  between vertical and horizontal or puts the bar back in its home position: the left edge of the drawing
  area, or the right edge while the floating panel (layers etc.) is over the left. A bar the panel would cover goes back there by itself.
  Sub-menus open toward the centre of the screen, and the position is remembered.
- **Selection style switch** — a status bar button switches clicks between
  CAD style (every click adds) and replace on click (Shift + click adds or removes,
  clicking empty space clears the selection). CAD style stays the default for now.
- **JWW / JWC (Jw_cad) import** — `.jww` and the older `.jwc` files open in the example app through
  `@mlightcad/cad-jww-converter` (MIT; parser: [ezjww](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/ezjww),
  Rust → WebAssembly, in a Web Worker). Coordinates are converted from paper
  millimetres to real millimetres with the layer-group scale, the sheet becomes
  the drawing limits, and layers are named `<group>-<layer> <names>`.
- **SXF import** (Japanese public-works CAD exchange standard) — `.sfc`, `.p21`
  and their ZIP forms `.sfz` / `.p2z` open in the example app through
  `@mlightcad/cad-sxf-converter` (MIT, TypeScript; ported from
  [ezsxf](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/ezsxf)). Partial drawings are shown at
  the real size of the main view, the sheet becomes the drawing limits.
- **Vertical text (縦書き)** — text in a Windows vertical font (`@ＭＳ ゴシック`, e.g. Jw_cad
  縦字) and TEXT whose text style has the AutoCAD "vertical" flag are written top to bottom
  on screen and in SVG / PDF export, with the bundled BIZ UD fonts
  (`@mlightcad/cad-vertical-text`).

## Demo

- Online: <https://cool0707.github.io/cad-viewer-plus/> (published from the
  `gh-pages` branch by `.github/workflows/demo.yml`)
- Local:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm demo:build   # build all packages and assemble demo-dist/
  pnpm demo         # http://localhost:4300/
  ```

The demo landing page (`demo/index.html`) links to the full viewer, the
simple viewer, the diff viewer and a font test drawing
(`resources/cad-data/samples/fonts-sample.dxf`). The full viewer also accepts
`?url=<drawing>`, `?new=1` and `?lang=ja|en|…`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 24
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) >= 10

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cool0707/cad-viewer-plus.git
cd cad-viewer-plus
pnpm install
```

### Develop

```bash
pnpm dev          # full-featured viewer (Vue + Element Plus)
pnpm dev:simple   # simple viewer (framework-agnostic)
pnpm dev:diff     # drawing comparison
```

### Build and test

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Fonts and resources

Everything the viewer downloads at runtime lives in `resources/cad-data/`
(see its [README](./resources/cad-data/README.md)):

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `fonts/fonts.json` | Font catalog (local files and Google Fonts URLs) |
| `fonts/*.woff` | BIZ UD Gothic / PGothic / Mincho / PMincho (SIL OFL 1.1) |
| `templates/acad*.dxf` | New-drawing templates |
| `samples/fonts-sample.dxf` | Font mapping test drawing |
| `samples/jww-sample.jww` | JWW sample (generated by `tools/make-jww-sample.mjs`) |
| `samples/sxf-sample.*` | SXF samples: `.sfc`, `.p21`, `.sfz`, `.p2z` (generated by `tools/make-sxf-sample.py`) |

The example apps copy this folder next to their build output. Hosts that embed
the packages directly can pass `baseUrl` to `AcApDocManager` (relative URLs are
resolved against the page) and change the fallback chain with the
`defaultFonts` / `symbolFonts` options.

SHX fonts are not bundled; text that uses them is drawn with BIZ UD Gothic and
reported in the notification center.

## Packages

The monorepo layout is unchanged from upstream:

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer` | Core viewer (no UI framework) |
| `@mlightcad/cad-viewer` | Full Vue 3 viewer with ribbon and palettes |
| `@mlightcad/cad-simple-ui-plugin` | Toolbar / layer / review UI for the simple viewer |
| `@mlightcad/cad-html-plugin`, `cad-pdf-plugin`, `cad-svg-plugin` | HTML / PDF / SVG export |
| `@mlightcad/cad-diff-viewer` | Side-by-side drawing comparison |
| `@mlightcad/three-renderer` | Three.js rendering |
| `@mlightcad/cad-jww-converter` | JWW (Jw_cad) reader (ezjww, WebAssembly) |
| `@mlightcad/cad-sxf-converter` | SXF (SFC / P21 / SFZ / P2Z) reader (TypeScript) |
| `@mlightcad/cad-vertical-text` | Vertical text (縦書き) layout shared by screen, SVG and PDF |

Package names keep the upstream `@mlightcad/` scope; this fork is not
published to npm.

## DWG support

DXF is parsed by the built-in MIT parser. DWG support is optional through
`@mlightcad/libredwg-converter`, which is based on
[LibreDWG](https://github.com/LibreDWG/libredwg) and licensed under **GPL-3.0**;
the example apps register it explicitly. Check the GPL implications before
distributing a product that includes it.

## JWW / JWC support

`@mlightcad/cad-jww-converter` reads Jw_cad drawings (`.jww`, and the older `.jwc`). It parses the file
with ezjww (MIT) in a Web Worker, converts it to DXF and loads it through the
built-in DXF reader. Register it and deploy `jww-parser-worker.js` and
`jww-parser.wasm` (both in the package's `dist/`) next to each other:

```ts
import { registerJwwConverter } from '@mlightcad/cad-jww-converter'

registerJwwConverter('./assets/jww-parser-worker.js')
```

JWW stores coordinates in paper millimetres. By default everything is scaled by
the scale of the main layer group (the one with the most entities), so the
drawing looks as it does in Jw_cad and the main drawing measures in real
millimetres. `scaleMode: 'layer-group'` scales each group by its own scale (like
Jw_cad's DXF export) and `scaleMode: 'paper'` keeps paper millimetres. JWC files are
converted the same way (they have no font information, so text uses ＭＳ ゴシック).
Images placed with `^@BM` are shown as raster images: images embedded in the JWW are
displayed directly, and images that refer to external files appear as missing images that you
can supply from the viewer. Trimmed images (Jw_cad 画像編集 → トリミング) show only the trimmed part
when the image is a BMP embedded in the JWW; other trimmed images are shown whole.

## SXF support

`@mlightcad/cad-sxf-converter` reads SXF Ver.3.1 drawings: SFC (`.sfc`), P21
(`.p21`, AP202) and their ZIP forms (`.sfz`, `.p2z`). The parser is written in
TypeScript (no WebAssembly) and its feature handling is ported from ezsxf (MIT).
The drawing is flattened into lines, curves, text, fills and hatches and loaded
through the built-in DXF reader.

```ts
import { registerSxfConverter } from '@mlightcad/cad-sxf-converter'

registerSxfConverter()
```

SXF coordinates are paper millimetres, and partial drawings (部分図) are placed
with a scale ratio. By default everything is scaled by the main partial
drawing's scale, so the sheet looks as printed and the main view measures in
real millimetres; `scaleMode: 'paper'` keeps paper millimetres. Circles, arcs
and ellipses stay true curves, and text is sized from its SXF character box.
Raster images (SXF 3.1 image attributes) are shown when the image file is bundled in the
`.sfz` / `.p2z`; monochrome TIFF (G4) is converted for the browser, JPEG is used as is. A plain
`.sfc` / `.p21` shows the image frame as a missing image. SAF attribute files are not loaded.
