# @mlightcad/cad-jww-converter

Jw_cad (`.jww`) reader for the CAD viewer. The file is parsed by
[ezjww](https://github.com/monozukuri-ai/ezjww) (MIT, Rust → WebAssembly) in a
Web Worker, converted to DXF (AC1024, UTF-8) and loaded by the registered DXF
converter, so layers, blocks and text styles follow the regular DXF path.

```ts
import { registerJwwConverter } from '@mlightcad/cad-jww-converter'

// Deploy dist/jww-parser-worker.js and dist/jww-parser.wasm side by side.
registerJwwConverter('./assets/jww-parser-worker.js')
```

After registration `AcApDocManager.openDocument('plan.jww', …)` / `openUrl(…)`
and the viewer's file dialogs accept `.jww`.

## Conversion

| JWW | Drawing |
| --- | --- |
| Paper millimetres | Real millimetres (`$INSUNITS` = mm), see `scaleMode` |
| Paper size (A0–A4, 2A–5A, 10m–100m) | `$LIMMIN` / `$LIMMAX` (centred on the origin) → "drawing limits" initial view |
| Layer group / layer | Layer `<group>-<layer> <group name> - <layer name>` (hex numbers as in Jw_cad); only used layers; hidden → frozen, protected → locked |
| Pen color, line type, width | ACI color, LTYPE (pattern in paper mm, entity linetype scale = drawing scale), lineweight (from ezjww) |
| Text font | Text style per font (ＭＳ ゴシック / ＭＳ 明朝 … → BIZ UD via `fonts.json`) |
| Text size (character cell height) | DXF height = cell × cap height / em of the substituted BIZ UD font, baseline raised by the descender — the renderer sizes TrueType text by the capital "A", which would otherwise draw Japanese text ~1.27× too large |
| Blocks | Block definitions + INSERT |
| Dimensions, solids | Lines + text, SOLID (from ezjww) |

`scaleMode` (`AcDbJwwConverterConfig`):

- `drawing` (default): everything is multiplied by the scale of the main layer
  group (the one with the most entities). The drawing looks as it does in
  Jw_cad and the main drawing measures in real millimetres.
- `layer-group`: each entity uses its own layer group's scale, like Jw_cad's DXF
  export. Groups with different scales (e.g. a 1/1 title block) no longer line up.
- `paper`: no scaling (paper millimetres).

Not supported yet: JWC (old format), JWS, embedded images (`^@BM`).

## ezjww in the browser

The published `ezjww` package is a Node build (wasm-pack `nodejs` target) that
reads the wasm with `fs` when it is loaded. `patches/ezjww@0.7.3.patch` turns
that into `initSync` / `initAsync`, which the worker calls with the fetched
`jww-parser.wasm`. Updating ezjww requires updating the patch.

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @mlightcad/cad-jww-converter build   # dist/ (library, worker, wasm)
npx jest packages/cad-jww-converter                # from the repository root
node tools/make-jww-sample.mjs                     # regenerate the sample drawing
```
